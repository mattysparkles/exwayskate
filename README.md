# exway Companion

A Flutter companion app for Exway electric skateboards. It connects over BLE to provide live telemetry, ride logging, rider levels, lighting control, and firmware updates. The app ships with a mock profile so you can explore the UI without hardware.

## Features

- Rider levels L1â€“L4 with turbo and custom curves
- Lighting commands for headlight, brake light and addressable LEDs
- Route logging and ride analytics (speed, distance, energy)
- Badge engine for milestones
- Support chat and accessories shop links
- Mock profile simulating telemetry and LED acknowledgements


## Quick Start

```bash
flutter pub get && flutter run
```

By default the app starts in **Mock Mode** with synthetic telemetry. To integrate with real hardware, implement a `BoardProfile` with the vendor's GATT UUIDs and packet layout.
