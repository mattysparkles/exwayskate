Subject: X-Ray Companion App – Partnership Request

Hi Exway Team,

We’ve built a clean-room Flutter app for your boards with mock telemetry. We’d love to integrate fully.

**What we need:**
- GATT UUID map & packet layout
- DFU/OTA documentation or SDK

**What you get:**
- Ready-to-brand Android/iOS app
- TestFlight/APK demos

Let us know if an NDA is required. Looking forward to working together!

Best,
The X-Ray Team
